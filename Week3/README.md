#Assignment1
The C program in Assignment 1 joins two 2D arrays in one array, 
then changes the order of combined arrays and finally prints them.

#Assignment2 
The C program in Assignment 2 is rather simple that it creates a function 
called "swapStrings", implements it over two strings and prints.
